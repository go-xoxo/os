-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)

-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.
